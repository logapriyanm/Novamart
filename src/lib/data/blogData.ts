            <p>Choosing the right solar panels is critical for maximizing ROI in commercial energy projects. In this guide, we explore the differences between Monocrystalline and Polycrystalline panels.</p>
            <h2>1. Efficiency Matters</h2>
            <p>Monocrystalline panels offer higher efficiency but come at a premium price. For space-constrained rooftops, they are the best choice.</p>
            <h2>2. Durability and Warranty</h2>
            <p>Always check for a 25-year performance warranty. Verified sellers on NovaMart ensure authentic products with valid manufacturer warranties.</p>
            <h2>3. Wholesale Pricing</h2>
